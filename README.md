Developed by Kevin Mason and David Olaoye 

# Elevator Pitch 
Space Farm is a game that takes place on a foreign planet and your job is to grow crops and maintain its ecosystem for a period of 30 days. You will be switching between two characters, an Agricultural Engineer (AE) and a Computer Scientist (CS), as your play. Each character has different functionality that will assist you in gameplay. Users will explore the different processes that go into maintaining an ecosystem, such as planting, watering, and harvesting crops while protecting the farm area from wildlife. The player is rewarded with a high score by maintaining this area over the required period of time. 

# Instructions 
You can move around the screen with the arrow keys.
You switch which mode you are using 1 and 2 which gives your character different functionality. 
You can plant crops, set mines and tubing using the SPACEBAR depending on which character and mode you are on. 
Make sure you are on the farm area (in brown) when you are planting seeds.
Pay attention to your farm area and protect it from invading wildlife.
