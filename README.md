# Space Farm 

Developed by Kevin Mason and David Olaoye 

Space Farm is a game that takes place on a foreign planet and your job is to grow crops and maintain its ecosystem for a period of 30 days. You will be switching between two characters, an Agricultural Engineer (AE) and a Computer Scientist (CS), as your play. Each character has different functionality that will assist you in gameplay. Users will explore the different processes that go into maintaining an ecosystem, such as planting, watering, and harvesting crops while protecting the farm area from wildlife. The player is rewarded with a high score by maintaining this area over the required period of time.
